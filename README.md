# 404-Wallpaper-Not-Found

A little project for a cool looking wallpaper

I used it with [Lively Wallpapers](https://www.rocksdanister.com/lively/)

## Setup Lively
All you have to do is go to the Release Page and download the latest Wallpaper.zip file. Extract the zip file into any folder. In lively wallpapers click on the plus button and select choose. Locate the folder and in the folder locate the index.html file. Select the file and you are ready to go.
